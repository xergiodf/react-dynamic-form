# Multi-step dynamic form

[DEMO](https://react-dynamic-form.xergiodf.vercel.app/)

This is the implementation of a small portion of the [Project Plan](https://github.com/xergiodf/react-dynamic-form/wiki/Project-Plan-(Task-%231)). The intention of this repository is to act as a Proof of Concept, tackling certain tasks from the [Milestones](https://github.com/xergiodf/react-dynamic-form/wiki/Project-Plan-(Task-%231)#milestones).

## Requirements

- [x] It should contain the screens in the design shown above. You're able to scope this however you want, including removing pages or fields where you think it might make sense. Just be prepared to explain your reasoning.
- [ ] When hitting "Finish" at the end it should log the result of the workflow.
- [ ] It should not let you progress to the next screen until all of the fields are valid.

## Conclusion

Trying to stay under the limit time (5 to 6 hours tops), the form is a rough implementation of the final result, but it shows progress using the API designed.

Working in parallel with other team members will definitely complete the first iteration goal.
